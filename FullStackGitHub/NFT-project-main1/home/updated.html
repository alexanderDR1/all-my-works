            <h2>--- some info about nft ---</h2>
            <p>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a record on a blockchain which is associated with a particular digital
                or physical asset. <br> <br> The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the blockchain, and can be
                transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded. <br> NFTs can be created by anybody,
                and require few or no coding skills to create. NFTs typically contain references to digital files
                such as photos, videos, and audio. Because NFTs are uniquely identifiable assets, they differ from
                cryptocurrencies, which are fungible.
                <br><br>
                Proponents of NFTs claim that NFTs provide a public certificate of authenticity or proof of
                ownership, but the legal rights conveyed by an NFT can be uncertain. The ownership of an NFT as
                defined by the blockchain has no inherent legal meaning, and does not necessarily grant copyright,
                intellectual property rights, or other legal rights over its associated digital file. An NFT does
                not restrict the sharing or copying of its associated digital file, and does not prevent the
                creation of NFTs that reference identical files.
                <br><br>
                The NFT market grew dramatically from 2020 - 2021: the trading of NFTs in 2021 increased to more
                than $17 billion, up by 21,000% over 2020's total of $82 million. NFTs have been used as speculative
                investments, and they have drawn increasing criticism for the energy cost and carbon footprint
                associated with validating blockchain transactions as well as their frequent use in art scams. The
                NFT market has also been compared to an economic bubble or a Ponzi scheme. By May 2022, the NFT
                market was seen as beginning to collapse.
